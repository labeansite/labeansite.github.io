Undergraduate student in Technological Chemistry at Campinas State University (UNICAMP). I worked with electrooxidation of glycerol using perovskites as electrocatalysts during my scientific initiation.  
I joined the alternative energy and nanomaterials laboratory (LEAN) as an intern in early 2023 and currently work with photoelectrochemistry for green hydrogen generation.
