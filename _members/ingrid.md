Ingrid holds a Ph.D. in physical chemistry from CINVESTAV-Mexico since 2019. She received an honorable mention for her dissertation that employs small perturbation optoelectronics techniques to analyze charge carrier dynamics at the semiconductor electrolyte interface. In the same year, Ingrid joined LEAN as a Postdoctoral Associate Researcher, focusing on surface and interface engineering of photoactive materials for green Hydrogen production. Her research interests center around characterizing photoactive materials to produce solar fuels via photochemical and photoelectrochemical methodologies. She is committed to optimizing advanced materials through in-situ and in-operando techniques and their scale-up.
